# Monetary Policy, Expectation and House Price

* The script serves as the code of my Master's Thesis at NTU Econ. 


## Replication Instruction

This R project is created with RStudio, so it works the best to run all the script under RStudio. All path is written in relative path under the project root folder.

You may also run all the scripts by the following command:
```shell
cd PROJECT_FOLDER
Rscript code/master_script.R
```

Please refer to `code/mater_script.R` for step-by-step details.
